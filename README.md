opencv over python tutorial - examples written exploring opencv capabilities using python as programming lenguaje - In the hope will be helpfull for someone

Also I will use AdafruitBBIO library to handle Beaglebone PWM outputs to control pan & tilt camera servos in some examples.

Files in his repository:

test-cam.py: simple camera test program which displays captured frames on a window.

servo-test.py: Uses Adafruit BBIO library to control a servomotor.

mouse-callback.py: example of use of callback function to add mouse interaction

rgb-hsv.py: this program shows a solid color image and several trackbars to choose RGB or HSV values of color shown. It is a very                    practical way to better understanding of RGB / HSV colorspaces.

pan-tilt.py: A couple of trackbars permit camera pan and tilt movement using microservos
